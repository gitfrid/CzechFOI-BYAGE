These scripts create the plot results:

Each script contains the variable plot_name, 
which is part of the name of the HTML plot file.

Each script has a function that creates a folder for the plot Output,
and copies the script into this folder.

Since a script can be executed with different parameters or CSV files, 
these parameters are documented in the script along with the HTML plot files.

To use the scripts with modules, they must first be imported in the Python console.
